## Topics

This post covers the second lecture in the course: "Convolutional Neural Networks." 

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revolutionized computer vision and played a central
role in ushering in the deep learning revolution. In this lecture, we will discuss the evolution of
CNNs, which form the backbone for many vision applications.

If you need an initial review of CNN architecture and concepts, consider reviewing the blog post listed first under "Web Resources" before watching the lecture or reviewing the accompanying notes.
