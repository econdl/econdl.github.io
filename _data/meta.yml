    EconDL is a comprehensive resource detailing applications of Deep Learning in Economics. 
    This is a companion website to the paper *Deep Learning for Economists* and aims to be a go-to resource 
    for economists and other social scientists for applying tools provided by deep learning in their 
    research. 
    

    This website contains user-friendly software and dataset resources, and a knowledge base 
    that goes into considerably more technical depth than is feasible in a review article. The demos 
    implement various applications explored in the paper, largely using open-source packages designed 
    with economists in mind. They require little background and will run in the cloud with minimal compute, 
    allowing readers with no deep learning background to gain hands-on experience implementing the 
    applications covered in the review.
